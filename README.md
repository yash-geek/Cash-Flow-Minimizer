Given a number of friends who have to give or take some amount of money from one another my algorithm minimizes the cash flow among people which is crucial among investment like things

In this application, you can find minimum cash flow between n people. Insert data in the table where cell represent the value one person has to pay to other person.I have represented them by i(owes) & j(owed). On computing the result, you will get answer with minimum cash flow between persons.
This algo uses `#Graph` and `#Greedy` method which is later optimised with adding `#heap` also. Time complexity is `O(n^2)`. Using min heap and max heap, the time complexity was reduced to `O(nlogn)` inside recursion.
The tech stack used to build this app is React Js.
